     * Up to maxFileCount log files can exist at a certain point in time. The oldest one is deleted, if the count
     * limit is exceeded before rotating the files (i.e. renaming the files).

     * Messages are not split across different log files. If a message does not fit into the current log file,
     * it will be written to the next file, after a rotation of the logfiles is performed.
     * Consequently, messages which are larger than mMaximumFileSize are not written to file at all!
